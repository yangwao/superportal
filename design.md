### mechanics

* mater will generate temporary token tied with member-uuid on backend
* member will recieve generated URL w/ short-lived/temporary token & member-uuid by master (i.e. Admin)
* member will open link via modern browser
* **magic happens**
* meanwhile on backend it will exchange temporary token for new generated long-lived token
* long-lived token will be stored on member's modern browser
* member is ready with authenticated modern device to access content
